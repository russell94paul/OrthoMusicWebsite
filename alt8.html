        <!--<p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Luciid (Luke Pollock) is a DJ/Producer who began in the quiet corners in the north of Ireland. His future-facing sound inspired but the foundations of techno pioneers is crafted perfectly with modern big-room techno. Luke brings a set that is fresh but distinctly recognisable. The alias ‘Luciid’ was curated in February 2018 as an outlet for creative ideas that varied anywhere between ambient & acid.</p>-->

          <p class="text-white-50 text-left">‘’Alt8’’born Evan Marshall is a DJ/Producer from the south east of Ireland who perpetuates his craft via his own interpretation of House & Techno. Respected for his indelible high energy DJ sets, Alt8 can set the tone in any musical scenario with his broad knowledge of electronic music and diverse taste in different styles.</p>

          <p class="text-white-50 text-left">In December 2017 Evan decided to create his ‘’Alt8’’ brand, to create a space independently to show progress on this new path. His track ‘’Amsterdam’’ has picked up some heat and is a proven club hit around the emerald isle. Evan’s main focus for 2019 is to release his arsenal of tracks that he has been keeping under wraps for along time, tour his ‘’GDWA8’’, and showcase his live skills at new venues. GDWA8: Alt8’s new concept called ‘’Going Down With Alt8’’Is something fresh & exciting to bring to the music scene. Each edition GDWA8 themes towards a different city In Europe and their Underground sounds.</p>

          <p class="text-white-50 text-left">The first edition in November 2018 saw an Amsterdam themed concept which saw over 900 attend, while January 2019 brought us to Berlin. Not only do the punters get to listen to a night of quality House & Techno as everyone who buys a presale ticket for the event is entered into a draw for a paid trip x2 to the chosen city of the event. (i.e. Amsterdam, Berlin).Currently Alt8 has held both events in the fantastic venue that is Factory Waterford, IE but future plans for GDWA8 would see the young Irishman take it on a tour.</p>

          <p class="text-white-50 text-left">Alt8 also independently releases a track for each event which is named after the city of each particular concept. With some exciting touring plans already locked in for 2019 such as appearances at Techworks Festival, 2019 will be the year Alt8 drags you onto the dancefloor, and sends you home wanting more.</p>
